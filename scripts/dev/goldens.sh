Usage: scripts/dev/goldens.sh [options] [-- <flutter test args>]

Runs the golden tests (--tags golden).

By default it verifies the rendered output against the committed references
under test/**/goldens/ci/. With --update it regenerates the references; review
the diff before committing, and commit only the ci/ flavor.

In CI (CI=true) only the committed Ahem flavor renders, so the same image
gates the build on every machine. Locally both flavors render: ci/ and the
gitignored platform preview.

Options:
  --update     Regenerate the references (--update-goldens).
  -h, --help   Show this help.

Launcher:
  Local runs use 'fvm flutter' (the SDK pinned in .fvmrc). CI (CI=true)
  or a machine without fvm uses plain 'flutter'. The SDK version is the
  same either way; only the command prefix differs, which is why this
  script exists rather than a hardcoded command.

Examples:
  scripts/dev/goldens.sh                  # verify against committed refs
  scripts/dev/goldens.sh --update         # regenerate refs
  scripts/dev/goldens.sh -- test/components/spinner   # one path
